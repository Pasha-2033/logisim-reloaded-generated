    <h1>What is logisim-reloaded?</h1>
    <p>This is a fix of classic logisim, to create new interfaces and elements to speed up simulation. Type of information broadcasting will be changed, that will help to simulate objects using data matrix (elements speed up and in parallel using, bit depth 32+, quantum computers simulating).</p>
    <p>Because of big difference between logism-reloaded-generaed and classic logism, use of classic logism source code is forbidden. Project works on its own data system and not compatible wih classic logism and logism evo (and with hc edition!)</p>
